<h1 style="color: darkgreen;">About Me</h1>
<p style="color: brown;">Hello, I am Jeetendra Tiwari and I am a Banker by profession working with IDBI Bank since last 15 years.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(120, 14, 32);">I lives in Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh) along with my parents, my better half Veenu and two lovely kids

<p style="color: rgb(194, 24, 24);">Before doing MBA in Marketing, i have done my Graduation in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering 
   and now at the age of 42 I have again developed an interest in Computer Programming. It all started when Python came in the school syllabus 
   of my son. While teaching him from his text book i found that i am enjoying coding. After this I have started coding in python and till date 
   I have learned to make basic programmes in Python. Along with python, now I also started to learn Web Development through an online course 
   which I have purchased from learning plarform UDEMY. That is all for now, I will keep this page updated with time.
